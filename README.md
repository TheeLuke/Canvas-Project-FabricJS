## Motivation
This project was created for my Advanced Web Development class at Edgewood College. I wanted to familiarize myself with FabricJS 4.0 to prepare myself for another project I am making known as, "Paradise Notes". 

## How to Use
- Download the latest release that contains the code files and examples.
- Verify that ```index.html```, ```script.js```, ```styler.css``` are in the same directory.
- Open ```index.html``` to begin using the canvas.
